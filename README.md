Ok next thing to work on is making it that you can select an individual colour
in the palette and use it to draw onto the tile. Then make it you can select
which tile to draw on.
When I have done those two things it would be good to make it that you can
select not just one tile but groups of them for editing, and maybe make it
display a grid on the editing screen so you can see where each one ends and
starts.
Once that works make it you can change the colours in the palette.
When that is done maybe start looking at importing/exporting actual snes binary
files.
After that maybe start working on stuff like different drawing tools. Line and
fill etc.
